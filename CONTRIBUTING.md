# ChesslabLab
## Open Source Community

The game of chess involves quite a few different aspects of software development, which makes it a perfect topic for learning full-stack web development as well as for playing around with machine learning libraries. A bunch of public chess repos ranging from React and JavaScript to PHP are available on the ChesslabLab community on GitHub.

### Contributing guidelines

- Find a ChesslabLab repo and make sure to read its `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- Look at the open issues.
- Leave the following comment on the issue you want to be assigned to: "Hi there, happy learning and coding!"
- Be prepared to create a friendly PR once the issue has been assigned to you.

Once you're ready, [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and create a new branch from `master` as per the following convention.

```text
$ git checkout -b issue/n-the-title-of-the-issue
```

For example, if the title of the issue is [Update to MUI 5 #236](https://github.com/chesslablab/redux-chess/issues/236) then its corresponding Git branch should be checked out from the main branch like this.

```text
$ git checkout -b issue/236-update-to-MUI-5
```

That's it! For further information please visit:

### But hang on a minute

It may not be as easy as it sounds, especially at the beginning of your career path to becoming a full-stack developer. So I thought that it'd be helpful to share some of my favorite episodes on creating a startupish product, from tesing and DevOps to data science, among others.

#### React

#### Testing

- [**How to Test React Components With Joy** There’s some joy in the realization that I’m taking it easy](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/looking-forward-to-testing-react-components-with-joy-5bb3f86c21d7)

- [**How to Unit Test Automatically Generated Images** Two images can be easily compared by matching their checksums](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-unit-test-automatically-generated-images-e8cd1fb668a8)

#### DevOps

#### Data Science

- [**How to Take Normalized Heuristic Pictures** Think of a chess game in terms of snapshots describing what’s going on on the board](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-take-normalized-heuristic-pictures-79ca0df4cdec)
- [**Visualizing Chess Openings Before MLP Classification** Chess positions are encoded as a combination of numbers between -1 and 1](https://medium.com/geekculture/visualizing-chess-openings-before-mlp-classification-fd2a3e8c266)

If you're looking forward to working on a startupish product —  or want to transfer your skills to a different stack —  but it still feels a little over your head, you may want to work together with a mentor solving ChesslabLab issues on GitHub.
