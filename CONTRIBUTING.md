## Open Source Community

The game of chess involves quite a few different aspects of software development, which makes it a perfect topic for learning full-stack web development as well as for playing around with machine learning libraries. A bunch of public chess repos ranging from React and JavaScript to PHP are available on the ChesslaBlab community on GitHub.
